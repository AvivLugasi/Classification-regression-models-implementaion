# Classification&regression models implementaion
implementaion of supervised learning models

This is the work of me and my co-student Guy Yehezkelâ€™s, this task was given to us in the course Machine learning.
The project contain:
our implementaion of:
-Classification Tree.

-Regression Tree.

-Adaboost classifier.

-Gradient boost regressor.

it also contains some pre proccessing steps that we performed on our data in order to maximize the predictions results,
such as:
SMOTE(Oversampling technique) in order to deal with imbalanced data classes,

log transform in order to deal with skewed features and one hot encoding for categorical features.

We also compared our results with the matched models of Scikit-Learn.
